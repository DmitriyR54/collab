                        Before Collab I was banging my head against the wall trying to make sense of my team-work. Now I am banging my head against the wall wondering why I didn't try it earlier. My head hurts and my wall has a big hole in it. But at least my team-work is pleasant again!

                        Collab bridges the gap between me and my colleagues more than anything else. It reintroduces context to development, limits cognitive load with choice architecture, grants access to a token library out of the box and is incredibly easy to pickup. It helped my design career so much.
